### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Brendan Lewis
#### Website and game development
Hi! My name is Brendan, and I'm a developer passionate about creating engaging, intuitive, and user-friendly applications.

In 2020, amidst the challenges of the pandemic, I seized the opportunity to delve into coding as a personal pursuit. It was a ton of fun, but I wanted to take this field more seriously and move to the next level. By 2021, I decided to deepen my knowledge by enrolling in a full-stack web development program at the University of Richmond. Once I graduated in 2022, I transitioned into the professional realm, securing a role at WayPath Consulting as a Developer and Consultant. However, I felt the need to further improve. This year, 2024, I enrolled at Western Governors University to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have always embraced, and continue to embrace, a continuous growth mindset, honing my skills through independent projects, educational courses, and hands-on experience in the field to become the best developer I can be.

In my free time, you can find me spending time with my partner and friends, playing video games, and consuming too much of the NBA. Of course, I code a lot. I'm working on some solo projects and a team project, both web and game development. One of them, I hope to share very soon.
