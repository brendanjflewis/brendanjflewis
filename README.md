### Hi there üëã

I'm Brendan from Virginia. I‚Äôm a creative and forward-thinking software developer who focuses on learning and creating cutting-edge websites and applications. I‚Äôm adept at project management and team leadership and am known for fostering collaboration and open communication within cross-functional teams. I excel at analytical problem-solving, driving innovation through effective teamwork, and ensuring code quality through rigorous veriÔ¨Åcation processes. Strong organizational adaptability rounds out my skill set, enabling me to deliver exceptional results in dynamic development environments.

In my free time I hang out with my partner, friends, and I play a lot of games. I also (shocker) code a lot! Currently I'm learning the Godot Engine and using it to create a small game project. I have some game projects up and running using Unreal Engine 5 and raylib as well. If and when I'm ready to share a project I'm working. You can find some updates here.
