### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Brendan Lewis
#### Website and game development
Hi! My name is Brendan, and I am passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly products.

In 2020, amidst the challenges of the pandemic, I seized the opportunity to delve into coding as a personal pursuit. By 2021, I decided to deepen my knowledge by enrolling in a full-stack web development program at the University of Richmond. Once I graduated in 2022, I transitioned into the professional realm, securing a role at WayPath Consulting as a Developer and Consultant. Since then, I have embraced a continuous growth mindset, honing my skills through independent projects, educational courses, and hands-on experience in the field.

In my free time, you can find me enjoying quality time with my partner and friends, playing or making games, and consuming too much of the NBA. Of course, I code a lot. With the launch of this new portfolio, I am back to sharpening my fundamentals while expanding my skill set. Currently, I am learning Godot Engine, maybe make a game!
